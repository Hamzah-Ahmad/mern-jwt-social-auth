This is a simple user authentication boilerplate for a mern application, which also uses redux. User can sign up and login using an email address and password, or their facebook or google account.

## Some steps to keep in mind:

Inside the default.json file in the config folder, add your mongoURI and a jwtsecret.
Inside the components folder burried within the client folder, add the facebook app id and google client id inside their component tags where required.
